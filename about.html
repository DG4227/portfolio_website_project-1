    <h2>Before Re:coded </h2>
    <form >
      <fieldset>
        <legend>I am from Iraq. I traveled to Syria in 2004 as a result of the American occupation of Iraq and the bad security conditions. <br>
         I graduated from Aleppo University, Faculty of Management and Economics, Department of Business Administration,and I was one of the top.
          <br>Then returned to Iraq as a result of the Syrian crisis to Mosul, and began to study the master there,and because of the entry of ISIS to the Mosul, displaced to Erbil (one of the northern provinces of Iraq) and finaly completed master's degree,
     and achieved honors in business administration.</legend>

      <h2>During Re:coded </h2>
      <form >
        <fieldset>
          <legend>  Always in every holiday or opportunity to enter a training course, I strive to get it and benefit from it.
        <br>I have entered many courses and I have a lot of  training certificates, and when I heard a training course to learn programming and English,
        I told myself it was an opportunity to strengthen my language and learn something new as programming
        I have already been tested for entry to Re:coded, and I have been chosen to be one of those covered in this course which
        includes Iraqi IDPs and Syrian refugees. <br>
        It was one of the most difficult courses ever because I did not have a background in programming,
        but it was the greatest opportunity to learn programming because
        I am without a teacher and attend classes I can not learn well in a completely different field. <br>
        The beauty of it is that I have met a lot of people from different cultural and educational backgrounds and age ranges. <br>
        And the concept of work has been developed and how to generate new ideas to start innovative projects and understand the labor market. <br>
        We have successfully completed the course with a lot of achievements and goals that we will pursue after this wonderful course
        </legend>

        <h2>After Re:coded </h2>
        <form >
          <fieldset>
            <legend>  After completing the Re:coded course, I plan to continue learning programming to strengthen my level of knowledge.
        And work in several fields, in the field of teaching university and in the field of teaching languages programming and design sites.
        There are a lot of plans and goals that I am thinking about because : there is no ceiling for my ambitions
