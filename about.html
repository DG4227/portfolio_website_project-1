    <p>I am from Iraq. I traveled to Syria in 2004 as a result of the American occupation of Iraq and the bad security conditions. <br>
     I graduated from Aleppo University, Faculty of Management and Economics, Department of Business Administration,
     and I was one of the top. <br>
Then returned to Iraq as a result of the Syrian crisis to Mosul, and began to study the master there,
and because of the entry of ISIS to the Mosul, <br> displaced to Erbil (one of the northern provinces of Iraq) and finaly completed master's degree,
 and achieved honors in business administration.</p>

  <p>
    Always in every holiday or opportunity to enter a training course, I strive to get it and benefit from it.
I have entered many courses and I have a lot of <br> training certificates, and when I heard a training course to learn programming and English,
I told myself it was an opportunity to strengthen my language  <br>and learn something new is programming
I have already been tested for entry to Re:coded, and I have been chosen to be one of those covered in this course  <br>which
includes Iraqi IDPs and Syrian refugees. <br>
It was one of the most difficult courses ever because I did not have a background in programming,
but it was the greatest opportunity to learn <br>programming because
I am without a teacher and attend classes I can not learn well in a completely different field. <br>
The beauty of it is that I have met a lot of people from different cultural and educational backgrounds and age ranges. <br>
And the concept of work has been developed and how to generate new ideas to start innovative projects and understand the labor market. <br>
We have successfully completed the course with a lot of achievements and goals that we will pursue after this wonderful course
